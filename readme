This repository contains the SQL script and ER diagram for an Airline Management System database. ✈️
It includes tables for Pilots, Flights, Passengers, and Bookings, implementing primary and foreign keys to maintain relationships: one-to-many between Pilots and Flights, and many-to-many between Flights and Passengers via the Bookings table.
The airline_schema.sql script creates the database and inserts sample data, while an ER diagram visually represents the database structure.
