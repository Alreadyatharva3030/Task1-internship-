This repository contains the SQL script and ER diagram for an Airline Management System database.
It includes tables for Pilots, Flights, Passengers, and Bookings, implementing primary and foreign keys to maintain relationships: one-to-many between Pilots and Flights, and many-to-many between Flights and Passengers via the Bookings table.
The airline_schema.sql script creates the database and inserts sample data, while an ER diagram visually represents the database structure.
